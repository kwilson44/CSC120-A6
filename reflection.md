- What are your initial impressions of how `Inheritance` affects your programming?
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

Things started out rough because of a series of unfortunate events I couldn't start until Saturday morning. All
that morning I barely made any progress and my inital impression was unsure and sad :(. Although, after messaging
you for help as well as taking a step back everything came together and realized everything was't as bad as I imagined.
Also I think I was stressed out about Montage (I'm in the handbell choir) so that distracted me as well. As I progressed through
this assignment my confidence and comfort in inheritance grew. Breaking down each section, writing explicit comments, and 
doing a little psuedocode really helped me. Freaking out and not taking a second to understand the material doesn't work. My
adivce I would give someone is to make sure you have a soild understanding of all the elements present. While overall, I don't 
like how easily I get confused with this and worry on how I'll perform in a time constraint situation, I feel like I grew a lot
in this assignment.
